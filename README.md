# BMAsBIC

This is an implementation of the small BMA experiment in my contribution to the discussion on the paper "A Bayesian information criterion for singular models" by M. Drton and M. Plummer [J. R. Stat. Soc. B 79 (2017) 1--38, arXiv:1309.0911].

The experiment is also present in my preprint [1].
